## **The Problem: The Silent Threat of Secret Leaks**

Managing secrets and environment variables is more than just an inconvenience; it's a massive security vulnerability.

**The Stakes Are High:**

-   **A Constant Barrage:** Security researchers find that **over 1,000 unique, hardcoded secrets** are leaked to public GitHub repositories _every single day_.
-   **The Cost of a Mistake:** According to IBM's 2024 "Cost of a Data Breach" report, the average cost of a data breach is **$4.45 million**. A single leaked credential can be the starting point for a catastrophic attack.

**The Old Way is Broken:** Manually managing `.env` files, copying templates, and sharing secrets over Slack is a recipe for disaster. It's not a matter of _if_ a secret will be leaked, but _when_.

---

## **Your Proactive Security Net**

EnvShield is more than just a workflow tool; it's your first line of defense against accidental secret leaks.

### **Never Commit a Secret Again: `envshield scan` & `install-hook`**

**How it improves development:** It makes it virtually impossible to accidentally commit a plaintext secret. This single feature provides immense peace of mind and protects your company from potentially devastating security breaches.

---

## **Streamlining Your Workflow**

Beyond security, EnvShield eliminates the daily friction of managing complex environments.

### **The "Before & After"**

**Before EnvShield:** A new developer spends half a day hunting for secrets, manually copying files, and debugging a broken setup.

**With EnvShield:** A new developer runs one command, `envshield onboard dev`, follows a guided wizard, and has a fully configured, running application in minutes.

---

## **Installation**

To install EnvShield, you will need a Python environment (version 3.10+).

```bash
# Install from PyPI (once published)
pip install envshield

# Or, directly from GitHub
pip install git+[https://github.com/rabbilyasar/envshield.git](https://github.com/rabbilyasar/envshield.git)
```

Verify the installation

```
envshield --help
```

## Core Concepts

-   **Profiles**: A named "state" for your environment (e.g., `local-dev`, `test`).
-   **Links**: A profile is defined by a set of `links`. A link tells EnvShield to take a `source` file and make it available as a `target` file via a symlink.
-   **Templates**: A `template` is a version-controlled "master blueprint" for a configuration file.

## Feature Guide & Demos

`envshield init` - **The Project Starter**

This interactive wizard creates your initial `envshield.yml` file.

`envshield onboard` - **The New Developer's Best Friend**

A single command that takes a new developer from a fresh `git clone` to a fully configured, running application by creating files, prompting for secrets, and running setup scripts.

`envshield list` & `use` - **Daily Context Switching**

Your day-to-day commands for managing your environment. `list` shows your options, and `use` activates one.

`envshield template` - **Preventing Configuration Drift**

Commands (`check` and `sync`) to keep your project's "master blueprint" up-to-date.

`envshield scan` & `install-hook` - **The Security Guard**

-   `envshield scan`: Scans files for secrets.

-   `envshield install-hook`: Installs a Git pre-commit hook to automatically scan staged files before every commit, blocking the commit if secrets are found.

## The `envshield.yml` File Explained

This file is the heart of your configuration. It's designed to be simple enough for a small project but powerful enough for a complex monorepo.

**For a Simple Project**

If you just use a single `.env` file, your configuration is clean and minimal.

```yaml
project_name: my-cool-api
profiles:
    dev:
        description: 'For local development.'
        links:
            - source: .env.dev
              target: .env
              template: .env.template
```

**For a Complex Project**
This is where EnvShield's power shines. The `links` system allows you to manage multiple, distinct configuration files under a single profile, each with its own template.

```yaml
project_name: rocket_launcher
profiles:
    local-dev:
        description: 'Standard local development with Docker.'
        links:
            - source: config/env_config.dev.py
              target: config/env_config.py
              template: config/env_config.local.py
            - source: .env.local-dev
              target: .env
              template: .env.template
            - source: python.env.local-dev
              target: python.env
              template: python.env.template
        onboarding_prompts:
            - SECRET_KEY
        post_onboard_script: './tools/ctl.sh pre-deploy'
secret_scanning:
    exclude_files:
        - 'node_modules/*'
```

## The Future of EnvShield: Roadmap

Phase 1 provides a complete solution for local environment management. The future of EnvShield is focused on enhancing security, team collaboration, and intelligence.

**Phase 2: The Secure Team Enabler**
_This is where our paid "Team" tier begins, offering features for professional teams._

-   **Encrypted Files**: Safely commit encrypted secret files to your repository. `envshield use` will transparently decrypt them.

-   **Secure P2P Secret Sharing**: Securely share secrets with teammates directly from the command line, eliminating the need for insecure channels like Slack.

-   **The Global Vault**: Securely store and sync your personal, cross-project secrets (like your `GITHUB_TOKEN`) to a private GitHub repo, so you only have to enter them once.

-   `envshield doctor`: A comprehensive health check command.

**Phase 3: The Intelligent Ecosystem**

_This is where we build our "Enterprise" tier and make EnvShield an indispensable part of the development lifecycle._

-   **Shell & Git Integration**: Automatically load/unload environments as you `cd`.

-   **Deployment Bridge** (`export`): Export configurations for Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

-   **Deep IDE Integration**: Get real-time feedback directly in your code editor.

We welcome feedback and contributions to make EnvShield the best tool it can be!
